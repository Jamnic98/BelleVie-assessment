# BelleVie Interview Coding Assessment

Technical assessment submission for my application to BelleVie.
This project consists of a client and server running as separate services.

## Tech Stack

### Front-End (Client)

The front-end is built with **React**. It utilises React components to render the user interface, handle state, and make requests to the back-end. The app is styled with Material UI for modern UI components.

### Back-End (Server)

The back-end is built with **Node.js** and **Express**. The server handles API requests, manages data processing, and serves the client with the necessary data. It interacts with the front-end to deliver information in a structured format.

## Running the Application

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies and start the client:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Server
